# old_custom_classes

These are the classes I used for my ML projects, I have started to remake these but using improved coding practices to reduce computational expense and to make it easier to edit them. When creating these I did not use Git which made their creation time-consuming, inefficient, and far more difficult. While these classes do work to some degree they are computationally expensive and difficult to modify without loss of functionality; this is because at the time I did not realise how important modularity is when creating extended pieces of code.
